# Smooth Like BUTR Licence (SLBLv1)
Copyright © 2026 [BUTR Corporation](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/16678872)

## 1. Creative Works, Assets & Design
All custom assets and creative works, including but not limited to:

- Custom Images, Logos, Resource Packs and Branding

- Any code or scripts we create (Python, Bash, Batch, etc.  )

- FancyMenu Layouts (`.txt` files from `[MODPACK]/fancymenu/customization/` and anything in the `[MODPACK]/fancymenu/assets/` folder)

Are **strictly proprietary**. You may NOT redistribute or incorporate these into other software/modpacks without explicit written permission from the following email: legal@butr.uk

## 2. Configurations
Permission is hereby granted free of charge to any person obtaining a copy of the configuration files (mainly located in folders like `[MODPACK]/config/`) to:

-  Modify and adapt the settings for personal or server use

- Share specific or few configurations and tweaks with the community and others

**Note:** This strictly does NOT include the right to redistribute the entire config folder as a standalone "copycat" pack since that would also contain our creative works like assets and FancyMenu layouts. 

## 3. General Terms
Our works (such as Modpacks or services) as a whole are provided "AS IS". This licence does not cover the individual mods contained within packs, which are subject to their own respective creators' licenses.

In no event shall **BUTR Corporation** be held liable for any claims or damages that may occur whilst you are using our software (including modpacks) or services. We do not care whether your PC grew legs and walked away or if it just crashed to desktop, we won't be paying. Our staff and community will try to provide help and support but we are not **required** to.

**Jurisdiction:** This licence is governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes shall be handled exclusively in the courts of England and Wales too.

## 4. A quick message from BUTR 💛
We are not Nintendo; we don't want to chase you down for copying the most simple of snippets or modifying assets to create a nice add-on for our packs (we LOVE that)

But- (and this is a very big but 🥁) if we do find you using our own copyrighted work in a way that poses a threat to us, we reserve the legal right to drop a very kind **Cease and Desist** letter through your mailbox.

Honestly from vro to vro and to keep you safe, I would always recommend asking legal@butr.uk and crediting us before you copy anything that could be considered our "creative works".
